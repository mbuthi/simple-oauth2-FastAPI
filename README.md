## What is oauth2
  This is a specification that handles authorization and authentication.
  It is an example of waht systems with "login with google or login with facebook".
  
  In Oauth2 the several ways to handle security are called `flows`.
  The various kinds of flows include:
  * implicit
  * clientCredentials
  * authorizationCode

  In this application I have implemented the password flow the `password flow`.
